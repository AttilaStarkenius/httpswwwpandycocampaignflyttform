@* 10.9.2022. I request to access ""pricerunner.se"" price comparison sites api because
    according to https://www.design.pricerunner.com/merchant-api
    "Before you can start to access our Merchant API you need to get a token from us."
    I decide, so long, create a sql database to this project
    with help of this website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/getting-started-with-mvc/getting-started-with-mvc-part4
    So in visual studio server explorer I right click
    on data connections and choose "Add connection"but I get error
    The Data Source value in the connection string specifies an instance of SQL Server that is not installed""
    I commit and push with message "10.9.2022. Adding database to project"*@

@* 15.9.2022. On a new computer I commit to Git Changes with message "15.9.2022. Commit all to Git
        Changes from a new computer when I push I to Git Changes I get error: Opening repositories:
