@* 10.9.2022. I request to access ""pricerunner.se"" price comparison sites api because
    according to https://www.design.pricerunner.com/merchant-api
    "Before you can start to access our Merchant API you need to get a token from us."
    I decide, so long, create a sql database to this project
    with help of this website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/getting-started-with-mvc/getting-started-with-mvc-part4
    So in visual studio server explorer I right click
    on data connections and choose "Add connection"but I get error
    The Data Source value in the connection string specifies an instance of SQL Server that is not installed""
    I commit and push with message "10.9.2022. Adding database to project"*@

@* 15.9.2022. On a new computer I commit to Git Changes with message "15.9.2022. Commit all to Git
        Changes from a new computer when I push I to Git Changes I get error: Opening repositories:

@* 16.9.2022. I try to fix the push fail "Opening repositories:

    by moving the project to source\repos map - earlier it was in \desktop map. I use simple
    commit message "16.9.2022. moving project from desktop to repos map, trying to fix fatal git error"
    and not until now github sign in web page https://github.com/login?client_id=0120e057bd645470c1ed&return_to=%2Flogin%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3D0120e057bd645470c1ed%26code_challenge%3DjRTWRTFCQ3uxVI0L-yYDa6cISG0Q0eKtvRvVJVVUOWM%26code_challenge_method%3DS256%26redirect_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A49708%252F%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Drepo%2Bgist%2Bworkflow%26state%3D5cf0ce44a2ca477fa102b520c5f57fb4
    pop up - I wasn't signed in github*@

@* 17.9.2022. I really want to do a cloth combination search page in MVC
    so I use this web page as tutorial: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/85ed7a/searching-and-paging-in-mvc/
    There is instruction "Create a table in the database with the name Employee.""
    First there has to be a database, so I name it ClothCombinationPriceEstimation and the table Cloth because
    I think it is more suitable in searching clothes scenario. I try to
    start sql server management studio but can't find it, I can't find the SSMS.exe file
    and it leads me to install Sql Server Management studio: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16
*@

@* 17.9.2022. I also look at https://javascript.plainenglish.io/its-2022-please-don-t-just-use-console-log-anymore-217638337c7d
    and try to use Console.Log Javascript method
    to demonstrate what I think a "Products" table for clothes looks like and
    I use this website: https://www.access-diva.com/dm8.html
    as an example so console.log({ ProductID, pItemID, pStyleID, pPrice, pDescription })
    I commit and push with message "17.9.2022. Testing console.log javascript method"

<script>
console.log({ ProductID, pItemID, pStyleID, pPrice, pDescription })
