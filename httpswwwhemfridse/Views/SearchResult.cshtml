@* 10.9.2022. I request to access ""pricerunner.se"" price comparison sites api because
    according to https://www.design.pricerunner.com/merchant-api
    "Before you can start to access our Merchant API you need to get a token from us."
    I decide, so long, create a sql database to this project
    with help of this website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/getting-started-with-mvc/getting-started-with-mvc-part4
    So in visual studio server explorer I right click
    on data connections and choose "Add connection"but I get error
    The Data Source value in the connection string specifies an instance of SQL Server that is not installed""
    I commit and push with message "10.9.2022. Adding database to project"*@

@* 15.9.2022. On a new computer I commit to Git Changes with message "15.9.2022. Commit all to Git
        Changes from a new computer when I push I to Git Changes I get error: Opening repositories:

@* 16.9.2022. I try to fix the push fail "Opening repositories:
    C:\Users\Attila\Desktop\httpswwwpandycocampaignflyttform

    by moving the project to source\repos map - earlier it was in \desktop map. I use simple
    commit message "16.9.2022. moving project from desktop to repos map, trying to fix fatal git error"
    and not until now github sign in web page https://github.com/login?client_id=0120e057bd645470c1ed&return_to=%2Flogin%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3D0120e057bd645470c1ed%26code_challenge%3DjRTWRTFCQ3uxVI0L-yYDa6cISG0Q0eKtvRvVJVVUOWM%26code_challenge_method%3DS256%26redirect_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A49708%252F%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Drepo%2Bgist%2Bworkflow%26state%3D5cf0ce44a2ca477fa102b520c5f57fb4
    pop up - I wasn't signed in github*@

@* 17.9.2022. I really want to do a cloth combination search page in MVC
    so I use this web page as tutorial: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/85ed7a/searching-and-paging-in-mvc/
    There is instruction "Create a table in the database with the name Employee.""
    First there has to be a database, so I name it ClothCombinationPriceEstimation and the table Cloth because
    I think it is more suitable in searching clothes scenario. I try to
    start sql server management studio but can't find it, I can't find the SSMS.exe file
    and it leads me to install Sql Server Management studio: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16
*@

@* 17.9.2022. I also look at https://javascript.plainenglish.io/its-2022-please-don-t-just-use-console-log-anymore-217638337c7d
    and try to use Console.Log Javascript method
    to demonstrate what I think a "Products" table for clothes looks like and
    I use this website: https://www.access-diva.com/dm8.html
    as an example so console.log({ ProductID, pItemID, pStyleID, pPrice, pDescription })
    I commit and push with message "17.9.2022. Testing console.log javascript method"
*@

<script>
    console.log({ ProductID, pItemID, pStyleID, pPrice, pDescription })
</script>


@* 18.9.2022. I get this error when I try to run Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio:

        The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.
    like explained on this website: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61630911/microsoft-sql-server-management-studio-error-at-startup *@

@* 18.9.2022. The issue with fail to start sql server management studio
    leads me to seek another solution like local database with help of this tutorial:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/data-tools/create-a-sql-database-by-using-a-designer?view=vs-2022
    I add project-> new item and notice that I really am missing
    the parts needed to do the tutorial, quoting the tutorial itself:
    "To complete this walkthrough, you'll need the .NET desktop development
    and Data storage and processing workloads installed
    in Visual Studio. To install them,
    open Visual Studio Installer and choose Modify (or More > Modify)
    next to the version of Visual Studio you want to modify."
    so that's what I do.
    Actually only Data storage and processing workloads
    were missing so I install those*@

@* 20.9.2022. I follow tutorial https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/data-tools/create-a-sql-database-by-using-a-designer?view=vs-2022
    so I want to add to project Service-based Database which I want to name ClothCombinationPriceEstimationDatabase
    but there is no Service based database item option, so I use this tutorial instead:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2wbqOFdvUE&ab_channel=ProgrammingProfessor
    I open Edit -> SQL Server object explorer -> SQL Server
    -> (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB -> Databases
    Which I right click and choose
    "Add New Database" and name it "ClothCombinationPriceEstimation"
    then I commit and push to git changes with
    message "20.9.2022. Adding local database ClothCombinationPriceEstimation"*@

@* 21.9.2022. I use
        https://www.access-diva.com/dm8.html
        as example like I
        mentioned earlies and The local database ClothCombinationPriceEstimation
        is now created in (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB
        and I go to Tables -> Add new table "tblProducts"
        whose T-SQL first looks like this(I haven't named
        the table to tblProducts yet): "CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Table]
    (
        [Id] INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
    )"
    Also I use this website as a tutorial
    like I have mentioned earlier:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2wbqOFdvUE&ab_channel=ProgrammingProfessor
    There is by default "Id" that is "int" and
    doest not allow null values. I rename it to "pProductID"
    and save the table as tblProducts but nothing really
    happens until I click "Update(database)",
I commit and push to git changes with message
    "21.9.2022. creating a
    local database table in the local
    database ClothCombinationPriceEstimation"
