@* 23.5.2022. My partial view _Header.cshtml doesn't have any content
        so I try to fix that with help of this website: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/partial-view-in-asp.net-mvc
        and especially this website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-pages/overview/ui-layouts-and-themes/3-creating-a-consistent-look
        from where I get advice about security: "Notice that the file name is _Header.cshtml, with an underscore (_) as
        a prefix. ASP.NET won't send a page to the browser if its name starts with an underscore.
        This prevents people from requesting (inadvertently or otherwise) these pages directly. It's a good idea to use an underscore to name pages that have content blocks in them, because you
        don't really want users to be able to request these pages — they exist strictly
        to be inserted into other pages."
        But content example I get from this website: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/partial-view-in-asp.net-mvc
        so I add: <div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="navbar-header">
                <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse">
                    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                </button>
                @Html.ActionLink("Application name", "Index", "Home", new { area = "" }, new { @class = "navbar-brand" })
            </div>
            <div class="navbar-collapse collapse">
                <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")</li>
                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("About", "About", "Home")</li>
                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Contact", "Contact", "Home")</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    but when I debug, nothing of header shows up. Partial view header
    has to be called from a cshthml-file. I commit and push with message
    "Filling partial view _Header.cshtml with content 23.5.2022."*@

    We added this condition due to have more space for other elements, epically for the mobile screens.

    Example, before we had a floating footer, and than have a feedback from our members to have more space for other elements.

    What do you think now of the feedback you provided, can we go further from here?

    What about making menu "sticky", showing up only when there is space for it without taking space from other elements, here is a citation with explanation what sticky is: "What does sticky footer mean?
    A sticky footer pattern is one where the footer of your page "sticks" to the bottom of the viewport in cases where the content is shorter than the viewport height." Though in this case, obviously, menu sticking to the top of the viewport is my suggestion. Viewport being only the part of the web page that you actually see at the moment on your screen

    Do you know bubble.io?

    We are building Conesult with bubble.io, maybe you could help us with mobile responsiveness,
    if there is any unresponsive elements on the platform?

    How do you look?

    Would you like be more of a creative and thinker? Problem solver?


    To test something and to see more about, you need to use, and experience that something.

    What if you can see Conesult as your platform, and that you can have own feature or any type of
    element that is labeled as you built it, what would be the element?

    Hey Toni, on the cell phone the support box is somewhat unresponsive, when
    you click on "Support" at the right bottom corner of the cell phone page
    conesult.com, the support box fills half of the page. There is not much
    possibility to see much of the page while writing message to support, so
    having a little bit of the web page kind of loses the meaning that it
    might have while surfing on a casual computer screen; to see much of
    the page AND the support box at the same time. I suggest that clicking
    "Support" while surfing on the cell phone page conesult.com, it leads
    to a new page that is completely a support page Best Regards, Attila Starkenius

    And on the support new page, you will hqvea bigger screen? 🤔 😁

    https://conesult.com/connect

    Support button serves as quick message to Conesult.

    How do you imagine to have it there, the best solution would be to have live support chat over the whole screen, but at the moment we can't do that.

    What do you see?
