Maybe a website that makes price estimation of clothes put together with different search options like for example: 1. The common patterns in combination of different clothes judging by google frequence of similar outfit, and 2. Trying to make an estimation of latest fashion by frequence of google results of outfits with very similar traits so search: "latest months common cloth combination" sort by either: Price, Popularity, Rating(According to some other referenced websites, because until this website eventually gets user ratings there is no ratings obviously and there it is: Possibility to register, log in, rate cloth combinations from 1 to 5 and leave comments about what was good or bad about some particular cloth combination or the website in general)

Mhmm, yes, but we can't ask here technical questions, we can but you will get no quality answers instead, consultation request is here for business-wise questions to be asked.

Hi Attila,

Now is the first time, when I saw this much of a development gap in your concept, but also in yourself!

It seems you have breached some limitations there, your concept is much clearer, although having "similar-to-Conesult" purpose, vision and mission" thing :D

This also says that you have a clearer understanding of the business world as well, i.e. business mode, pitch, etc :)

Would you like to create a Consultation request, and engage little bit with the community? :D

That is our goal, to have big pool of suppliers.

Do you have any advice how to reach suppliers, or should we just fetch prices with additional softwares, or should we contact them first as to establish some form of a connection?

The concept could be seen as being between clothing stores and buyers to predict and customize the shopping experience. 
 
One idea is to have a fee for businesses that would like to use your service as complimentary (b2b), and another idea is to have a subscription base pricing plan and go b2c, which is for buyers to pay and continue to use your service for a better shopping experience. 
 
Something to keep in mind is that b2c (business to customer) would be much easier to start with and require less investment in the beginning compared to b2b (business to business), where customers would be related clothing shops with whom a new entity in a market would have a "harder time" connecting with (in the beginning).
 
I look forward to hearing from you more about what you see at this moment in regards to these two ideas, and if you have another pricing concept in mind, and also I am looking forward to you updating your concept business plan "customer section" in particular.
 
Something that is worth doing and something you can learn a lot and save time here is doing research on other similar concepts in the market (i.e., competition), which will make a customer section easier for you to fulfill as well.

One option is to implement commissions on every bought garment and offer that as an additional service to the stores. Otherwise, could you create an addition that the stores have on their webpage and takes a subscription fee for the service.

Another option is to create a Software as a Service (SaaS) for the stores, but then it is just B2B oriented. Since B2B requires high initial investment costs, the recommended approach is to start with commissions to get data on the use of the service.

This was my first idea, to have own additional fee, but now it seems I need to do more of a research, as few more doors has been opened here for me, one of which you mention, b2b, another is b2c.

Selling fee could be implemented on both, whereas first is to establish the bigger pricing strategy, e.g. b2b or b2c.

I'll definitely agree with another comment that suggests creating a big database. In this type of work, doing it manually is way too time-consuming and some software implementation is absolutely a must. 

Other than that, it's a quite difficult concept and it would be hard to realize without significant data backing. Perhaps acquiring data from, or insights about the industry might be a good start.

Is there a way that you see how we could make this process easier, in the best case for others, e.g. retailers to help us fill-in the database, or what would be a concept here exactly, perhaps as part of the pricing plan?

I also consider creating a database with the different suppliers prices is a good approach to begin with. The data could be collected from offering the service in exchange of  a comission for the clothes bought (as someone else recommended), and also additional software could be used to support the collection and to check its consistency.

Okay! It seems that database is the one of the main, and if not a main aspect of my concept here. The question is now that I came as far, how to make the filling of the data? Do you think we can create enough value for retailers to fill-in own data?

Hi,
Here are a few pointers to help you decide how to choose the best pricing strategy

1. Understand your clients.
Who are they? What do they do? What are they likely to do? What are they not likely to do?
People always have a pattern of behavior. Understanding the pattern will allow you to understand things such as their financial capacity, the kind of products they consume, how they'll react to changes in price, etc.

2. Who are your competitors?
What is the pricing strategy common among businesses in the same trade? What is the reasoning behind that pricing strategy? What are the advantages? Disadvantages? How would your business fare if you adopted the same pricing strategy as your competitors?
Understanding your competitors will give you insight into the industry trends. You'll be able to know your competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and pick or develop a pricing strategy that is stronger and more sustainable than theirs. Are your competitors likely to adopt a new pricing strategy in ten years? Five years? How sustainable are their pricing strategies?
Or you'll be able to know if the current trend is something that can last, something you should adopt for your own business.

3. Understand your business
What are the resources you have at your disposal? What kind of risks can your business take? How can your business handle losses? Understanding all this will help you decide if you want to adopt a relatively safer pricing strategy.

We added this condition due to have more space for other elements, epically for the mobile screens.

What about making menu "sticky", showing up only when there is space for it without taking space from other elements, here is a citation with explanation what sticky is: "What does sticky footer mean?
A sticky footer pattern is one where the footer of your page "sticks" to the bottom of the viewport in cases where the content is shorter than the viewport height." Though in this case, obviously, menu sticking to the top of the viewport is my suggestion. Viewport being only the part of the web page that you actually see at the moment on your screen

Hey Toni, on the cell phone the support box is somewhat unresponsive, when you click on "Support" at the right bottom corner of the cell phone page conesult.com, the support box fills half of the page. There is not much possibility to see much of the page while writing message to support, so having a little bit of the web page kind of loses the meaning that it might have while surfing on a casual computer screen; to see much of the page AND the support box at the same time. I suggest that clicking "Support" while surfing on the cell phone page conesult.com, it leads to a new page that is completely a support page Best Regards, Attila Starkenius

How do you imagine to have it there, the best solution would be to have live support chat over the whole screen, but at the moment we can't do that.

    One idea is to have a fee for businesses that would like to use your service as complimentary (b2b), and another idea is to have a subscription base pricing plan and go b2c, which is for buyers to pay and continue to use your service for a better shopping experience.

    Something to keep in mind is that b2c (business to customer) would be much easier to start with and require less investment in the beginning compared to b2b (business to business), where customers would be related clothing shops with whom a new entity in a market would have a "harder time" connecting with (in the beginning).

    I look forward to hearing from you more about what you see at this moment in regards to these two ideas, and if you have another pricing concept in mind, and also I am looking forward to you updating your concept business plan "customer section" in particular.

    Something that is worth doing and something you can learn a lot and save time here is doing research on other similar concepts in the market (i.e., competition), which will make a customer section easier for you to fulfill as well.

    Ok, thanks! Will write this down, as to explore further, b2b or b2c! And will reach to you if there are any related questions, or simply next time I can create a more specific consultation request to one of those.

    One option is to implement commissions on every bought garment and offer that as an additional service to the stores. Otherwise, could you create an addition that the stores have on their webpage and takes a subscription fee for the service.

    Another option is to create a Software as a Service (SaaS) for the stores, but then it is just B2B oriented. Since B2B requires high initial investment costs, the recommended approach is to start with commissions to get data on the use of the service.

    This was my first idea, to have own additional fee, but now it seems I need to do more of a research, as few more doors has been opened here for me, one of which you mention, b2b, another is b2c.

    Selling fee could be implemented on both, whereas first is to establish the bigger pricing strategy, e.g. b2b or b2c.

    I'll definitely agree with another comment that suggests creating a big database. In this type of work, doing it manually is way too time-consuming and some software implementation is absolutely a must.

    Other than that, it's a quite difficult concept and it would be hard to realize without significant data backing. Perhaps acquiring data from, or insights about the industry might be a good start.

    Is there a way that you see how we could make this process easier, in the best case for others, e.g. retailers to help us fill-in the database, or what would be a concept here exactly, perhaps as part of the pricing plan?

    Hmm, that's an interesting question. I thought about getting and, if neccessary, purchasing data through retailers or from any other holders of data. There're quite a few companies specializing in that, so that might be a good bet. If there're none, then collecting the data from retailers and other sources might take some time and likely not be fully complete, but that should give enough to start the project and continuously gather data over time.

    Other than that, I don't have much to add.

    I also consider creating a database with the different suppliers prices is a good approach to begin with. The data could be collected from offering the service in exchange of  a comission for the clothes bought (as someone else recommended), and also additional software could be used to support the collection and to check its consistency.

    Hi,
    Here are a few pointers to help you decide how to choose the best pricing strategy

    1. Understand your clients.
    Who are they? What do they do? What are they likely to do? What are they not likely to do?
    People always have a pattern of behavior. Understanding the pattern will allow you to understand things such as their financial capacity, the kind of products they consume, how they'll react to changes in price, etc.

    2. Who are your competitors?
    What is the pricing strategy common among businesses in the same trade? What is the reasoning behind that pricing strategy? What are the advantages? Disadvantages? How would your business fare if you adopted the same pricing strategy as your competitors?
    Understanding your competitors will give you insight into the industry trends. You'll be able to know your competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and pick or develop a pricing strategy that is stronger and more sustainable than theirs. Are your competitors likely to adopt a new pricing strategy in ten years? Five years? How sustainable are their pricing strategies?
    Or you'll be able to know if the current trend is something that can last, something you should adopt for your own business.

    3. Understand your business
    What are the resources you have at your disposal? What kind of risks can your business take? How can your business handle losses? Understanding all this will help you decide if you want to adopt a relatively safer pricing strategy.

    One of the recent courses at Stockholm Business School I was in a project group with a guy who had a similar idea for years...  we processed it and presented it but I'm not sure if I can find the materials. It was a web-app (both website and app) that would allow people to mix&match things, try them out virtually, share the outfits and wardrobes that they "collected", etc, etc.

    I was just relieved that for once it's not my idea that's being used for a project. Don't remember the guy's name either... it was a single course, outside of my Master's Programme Curriculum.

    Anyway, I guess the point of my post is that you shouldn't limit the scope of value/service and also if anything that I wrote gave you any ideas, you're welcome.

    Of course the idea was to "milk" the big clothing companies for money in return for exposure. I can't recall if there were any ideas about other "paths" to financial gain... Oh well.

    Update: I found the paper from the course (business model elaboration) as well as the guy who had the idea.

Hi Atilla,

No for code, if there is advertising part which we don't like..

There is another option for us to have a very good chat feature, to redirect our chats at email, for example Gmail that can be sent and started through Conesult.


Btw. I have seen your "not appropriate" consultation request proposal. Can you share about that a bit? Not related in any way, toward the feature usage, nor toward the concept itself with the proposal.

Thanks for the consultation comment!

That is our goal, to have big pool of suppliers.

Do you have any advice how to reach suppliers, or should we just fetch prices with additional softwares, or should we contact them first as to establish some form of a connection?

First I'd would suggest that the narrow focus on price is not going to give you the full picture of how the end-customers purchases clothing. There are more factors going in to it. But there is probably a big customer base being very price sensitive in most of their purchases. But if you want to aim for a bigger audience you need to cater for end-customer who acts on other factors when conducting a purchase. With the broader scope, you'd probably have a greater chance of getting an answer to your sub-question "... what are the most popular ways to combine clothes that you buy online".

Next thing for you to ideate on is how are you going to attract users to your website? My problem I see is - from an end-customer's point of view - all this is manageble via search engines today. Google shopping is gathering data about you and probably has a great idea of what pricing level you are on when it comes to clothing. You need to work out an USP for you website to drag the customers attention and create a need to go through your site. You have any mock-ups of your idea?

Hey, 

That would be appreciated! 

I am planning to start Python courses. I asked around and did some research, and ended up that Python is the best fit as a programing language starter. Plus, it is relevant to InfoSec. Though, you did not mention it on your profile. 

Looking at my profile, what would you advise me? 
Best,
Emna.

Maybe a website that makes price estimation of clothes put together with different search options like for example: 1. The common patterns in combination of different clothes judging by google frequence of similar outfit, and 2. Trying to make an estimation of latest fashion by frequence of google results of outfits with very similar traits so search: "latest months common cloth combination" sort by either: Price, Popularity, Rating(According to some other referenced websites, because until this website eventually gets user ratings there is no ratings obviously and there it is: Possibility to register, log in, rate cloth combinations from 1 to 5 and leave comments about what was good or bad about some particular cloth combination or the website in general)

We added this condition due to have more space for other elements, epically for the mobile screens.

What about making menu "sticky", showing up only when there is space for it without taking space from other elements, here is a citation with explanation what sticky is: "What does sticky footer mean?
A sticky footer pattern is one where the footer of your page "sticks" to the bottom of the viewport in cases where the content is shorter than the viewport height." Though in this case, obviously, menu sticking to the top of the viewport is my suggestion. Viewport being only the part of the web page that you actually see at the moment on your screen

Hey Toni, on the cell phone the support box is somewhat unresponsive, when you click on "Support" at the right bottom corner of the cell phone page conesult.com, the support box fills half of the page. There is not much possibility to see much of the page while writing message to support, so having a little bit of the web page kind of loses the meaning that it might have while surfing on a casual computer screen; to see much of the page AND the support box at the same time. I suggest that clicking "Support" while surfing on the cell phone page conesult.com, it leads to a new page that is completely a support page Best Regards, Attila Starkenius

Creating big base with different suppliers prices. 
Prices can be "scraped" from sites with additional softwares.

Thanks for the consultation comment!

That is our goal, to have big pool of suppliers.

Do you have any advice how to reach suppliers, or should we just fetch prices with additional softwares, or should we contact them first as to establish some form of a connection?

The concept could be seen as being between clothing stores and buyers to predict and customize the shopping experience. 
 
One idea is to have a fee for businesses that would like to use your service as complimentary (b2b), and another idea is to have a subscription base pricing plan and go b2c, which is for buyers to pay and continue to use your service for a better shopping experience. 
 
Something to keep in mind is that b2c (business to customer) would be much easier to start with and require less investment in the beginning compared to b2b (business to business), where customers would be related clothing shops with whom a new entity in a market would have a "harder time" connecting with (in the beginning).
 
I look forward to hearing from you more about what you see at this moment in regards to these two ideas, and if you have another pricing concept in mind, and also I am looking forward to you updating your concept business plan "customer section" in particular.
 
Something that is worth doing and something you can learn a lot and save time here is doing research on other similar concepts in the market (i.e., competition), which will make a customer section easier for you to fulfill as well.

One option is to implement commissions on every bought garment and offer that as an additional service to the stores. Otherwise, could you create an addition that the stores have on their webpage and takes a subscription fee for the service.

Another option is to create a Software as a Service (SaaS) for the stores, but then it is just B2B oriented. Since B2B requires high initial investment costs, the recommended approach is to start with commissions to get data on the use of the service.

This was my first idea, to have own additional fee, but now it seems I need to do more of a research, as few more doors has been opened here for me, one of which you mention, b2b, another is b2c.

Selling fee could be implemented on both, whereas first is to establish the bigger pricing strategy, e.g. b2b or b2c.

I'll definitely agree with another comment that suggests creating a big database. In this type of work, doing it manually is way too time-consuming and some software implementation is absolutely a must. 

Other than that, it's a quite difficult concept and it would be hard to realize without significant data backing. Perhaps acquiring data from, or insights about the industry might be a good start.

Is there a way that you see how we could make this process easier, in the best case for others, e.g. retailers to help us fill-in the database, or what would be a concept here exactly, perhaps as part of the pricing plan?

Hmm, that's an interesting question. I thought about getting and, if neccessary, purchasing data through retailers or from any other holders of data. There're quite a few companies specializing in that, so that might be a good bet. If there're none, then collecting the data from retailers and other sources might take some time and likely not be fully complete, but that should give enough to start the project and continuously gather data over time. 

Other than that, I don't have much to add.

I also consider creating a database with the different suppliers prices is a good approach to begin with. The data could be collected from offering the service in exchange of  a comission for the clothes bought (as someone else recommended), and also additional software could be used to support the collection and to check its consistency.

Okay! It seems that database is the one of the main, and if not a main aspect of my concept here. The question is now that I came as far, how to make the filling of the data? Do you think we can create enough value for retailers to fill-in own data?

Sorry for late reply. I mean that, is there a way to do a database with the different suppliers prices that is not too expensive,  now in the beginning when I am uncertain about how realistic my price plan is? Best Regards, Attila

Hi,
Here are a few pointers to help you decide how to choose the best pricing strategy

1. Understand your clients.
Who are they? What do they do? What are they likely to do? What are they not likely to do?
People always have a pattern of behavior. Understanding the pattern will allow you to understand things such as their financial capacity, the kind of products they consume, how they'll react to changes in price, etc.

2. Who are your competitors?
What is the pricing strategy common among businesses in the same trade? What is the reasoning behind that pricing strategy? What are the advantages? Disadvantages? How would your business fare if you adopted the same pricing strategy as your competitors?
Understanding your competitors will give you insight into the industry trends. You'll be able to know your competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and pick or develop a pricing strategy that is stronger and more sustainable than theirs. Are your competitors likely to adopt a new pricing strategy in ten years? Five years? How sustainable are their pricing strategies?
Or you'll be able to know if the current trend is something that can last, something you should adopt for your own business.

3. Understand your business
What are the resources you have at your disposal? What kind of risks can your business take? How can your business handle losses? Understanding all this will help you decide if you want to adopt a relatively safer pricing strategy.

One of the recent courses at Stockholm Business School I was in a project group with a guy who had a similar idea for years...  we processed it and presented it but I'm not sure if I can find the materials. It was a web-app (both website and app) that would allow people to mix&match things, try them out virtually, share the outfits and wardrobes that they "collected", etc, etc. 

I was just relieved that for once it's not my idea that's being used for a project. Don't remember the guy's name either... it was a single course, outside of my Master's Programme Curriculum. 

Anyway, I guess the point of my post is that you shouldn't limit the scope of value/service and also if anything that I wrote gave you any ideas, you're welcome. 

Of course the idea was to "milk" the big clothing companies for money in return for exposure. I can't recall if there were any ideas about other "paths" to financial gain... Oh well.

Update: I found the paper from the course (business model elaboration) as well as the guy who had the idea.

Hi, 

First I'd would suggest that the narrow focus on price is not going to give you the full picture of how the end-customers purchases clothing. There are more factors going in to it. But there is probably a big customer base being very price sensitive in most of their purchases. But if you want to aim for a bigger audience you need to cater for end-customer who acts on other factors when conducting a purchase. With the broader scope, you'd probably have a greater chance of getting an answer to your sub-question "... what are the most popular ways to combine clothes that you buy online".

Next thing for you to ideate on is how are you going to attract users to your website? My problem I see is - from an end-customer's point of view - all this is manageble via search engines today. Google shopping is gathering data about you and probably has a great idea of what pricing level you are on when it comes to clothing. You need to work out an USP for you website to drag the customers attention and create a need to go through your site. You have any mock-ups of your idea?

Hi, hope you are good!

Could you project a rough number for how much you could replicate our web application (www.conesult.com) with custom code, for example now we are building it with bubble.io, while speaking with investors how to scale, we are thinking of this investment.

Hope this is fine for you!

Thanks! Looking forward to hearing from you!

Okay, it seems is not possible to tweak that much Google Maps, or it takes a bit of more budget.

I think I've found option for us, with another third party Map, that uses Google maps within the API itself.
