Maybe a website that makes price estimation of clothes put together with different search options like for example: 1. The common patterns in combination of different clothes judging by google frequence of similar outfit, and 2. Trying to make an estimation of latest fashion by frequence of google results of outfits with very similar traits so search: "latest months common cloth combination" sort by either: Price, Popularity, Rating(According to some other referenced websites, because until this website eventually gets user ratings there is no ratings obviously and there it is: Possibility to register, log in, rate cloth combinations from 1 to 5 and leave comments about what was good or bad about some particular cloth combination or the website in general)

Well, your website is unorganized, can you clarity it a bit? 
What is the purpose of the website?
It's much better, but needs further clarification.
I find it hard to put this correct way, when there is a lot of 
bigger problems in Ukraine than fading brands, 
but supporting Ukrainian fashion brands as a part of the ecomonic 
recovery(I use this website as a reference because I thought

If i try to rephase the question to "How to make a pricing strategy for a price comparison website?" what do you think about that question?
Attila Starkenius

06:27, Friday, 06/05/22
Mhmm, yes, but we can't ask here technical questions, we can but you will get no quality answers instead, consultation request is here for business-wise questions to be asked.

Maybe we can rephrase the same question to me in regards to the by model terms, something like we have a problem and solution here, and then how to structure it for customers to use it, or perhaps something else?

Hi Attila,

Now is the first time, when I saw this much of a development gap in your concept, but also in yourself!

It seems you have breached some limitations there, your concept is much clearer, although having "similar-to-Conesult" purpose, vision and mission" thing :D

This also says that you have a clearer understanding of the business world as well, i.e. business mode, pitch, etc :)

Would you like to create a Consultation request, and engage little bit with the community? :D

Congrats Atilla!

Creating big base with different suppliers prices. 
Prices can be "scraped" from sites with additional softwares.

Thanks for the consultation comment!

That is our goal, to have big pool of suppliers.

Do you have any advice how to reach suppliers, or should we just fetch prices with additional softwares, or should we contact them first as to establish some form of a connection?

The concept could be seen as being between clothing stores and buyers to predict and customize the shopping experience. 
 
One idea is to have a fee for businesses that would like to use your service as complimentary (b2b), and another idea is to have a subscription base pricing plan and go b2c, which is for buyers to pay and continue to use your service for a better shopping experience. 
 
Something to keep in mind is that b2c (business to customer) would be much easier to start with and require less investment in the beginning compared to b2b (business to business), where customers would be related clothing shops with whom a new entity in a market would have a "harder time" connecting with (in the beginning).
 
I look forward to hearing from you more about what you see at this moment in regards to these two ideas, and if you have another pricing concept in mind, and also I am looking forward to you updating your concept business plan "customer section" in particular.
 
Something that is worth doing and something you can learn a lot and save time here is doing research on other similar concepts in the market (i.e., competition), which will make a customer section easier for you to fulfill as well.

One option is to implement commissions on every bought garment and offer that as an additional service to the stores. Otherwise, could you create an addition that the stores have on their webpage and takes a subscription fee for the service.

Another option is to create a Software as a Service (SaaS) for the stores, but then it is just B2B oriented. Since B2B requires high initial investment costs, the recommended approach is to start with commissions to get data on the use of the service.

This was my first idea, to have own additional fee, but now it seems I need to do more of a research, as few more doors has been opened here for me, one of which you mention, b2b, another is b2c.

Selling fee could be implemented on both, whereas first is to establish the bigger pricing strategy, e.g. b2b or b2c.

I'll definitely agree with another comment that suggests creating a big database. In this type of work, doing it manually is way too time-consuming and some software implementation is absolutely a must. 

Other than that, it's a quite difficult concept and it would be hard to realize without significant data backing. Perhaps acquiring data from, or insights about the industry might be a good start.

Is there a way that you see how we could make this process easier, in the best case for others, e.g. retailers to help us fill-in the database, or what would be a concept here exactly, perhaps as part of the pricing plan?

I also consider creating a database with the different suppliers prices is a good approach to begin with. The data could be collected from offering the service in exchange of  a comission for the clothes bought (as someone else recommended), and also additional software could be used to support the collection and to check its consistency.

Okay! It seems that database is the one of the main, and if not a main aspect of my concept here. The question is now that I came as far, how to make the filling of the data? Do you think we can create enough value for retailers to fill-in own data?

Hi,
Here are a few pointers to help you decide how to choose the best pricing strategy

1. Understand your clients.
Who are they? What do they do? What are they likely to do? What are they not likely to do?
People always have a pattern of behavior. Understanding the pattern will allow you to understand things such as their financial capacity, the kind of products they consume, how they'll react to changes in price, etc.

2. Who are your competitors?
What is the pricing strategy common among businesses in the same trade? What is the reasoning behind that pricing strategy? What are the advantages? Disadvantages? How would your business fare if you adopted the same pricing strategy as your competitors?
Understanding your competitors will give you insight into the industry trends. You'll be able to know your competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and pick or develop a pricing strategy that is stronger and more sustainable than theirs. Are your competitors likely to adopt a new pricing strategy in ten years? Five years? How sustainable are their pricing strategies?
Or you'll be able to know if the current trend is something that can last, something you should adopt for your own business.

3. Understand your business
What are the resources you have at your disposal? What kind of risks can your business take? How can your business handle losses? Understanding all this will help you decide if you want to adopt a relatively safer pricing strategy.

Okay! Great! Now you see concept how to develop anything, you share, learn and update.

Well, I am looking for us here to focus on the web development, as you are here one year with us and we haven't done much in regards to Conesult website... 😁

Okay, before we continue here, could you share what you are good with first, so that we can connect with appropriate tasks here?

Not perhaps languages, as Conesult is built without language, more of a drag and drop tool, whereas there is like 1% of our platform that is built witu code.. Html or java..
